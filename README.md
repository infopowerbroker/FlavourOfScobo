Making Scare Hobos (Scobos) the easy way!

What does it do?
----------------
This script will:
1) Check Richard's Stockpile in Hobopolis to see what elemental Scare Hobo parts are least in stock,
2) Set the Flavor of Magic to the right element to fill that gap
3) Adventure 5 adventures running YOUR OWN CCS to fill parts

It does not generate Hobo Skins - that physical damange must be done manually.

What Prerequistes do I need?
----------------------------
You MUST have the Flavour of Magic skill for this script to work.
You MUST have a CCS set that will properly over-kill the hobos to create parts
You SHOULD have enough +Bonus Spell Damage in our outfit to ensure the CCS will over-kill the hobos

I recommend Stuffed Mortar Shell + Extract Source Essence (or another minor skill/item that will not kill the hobo)

How do I use it?
----------------
First, install it by running this command in KoLmafia's graphical CLI:

<pre>
git checkout https://github.com/infopowerbroker/FlavourOfScobo.git release
</pre>

When you run it, it will run for 5 adventures. Run it multiple times to use the needed number of turns (making Scobos along the way).
